# 3YR-Project

This is the Public Repository for my 3rd Year Undergraduate Project on Classification of Brain Tissue Using Multiparametric MRI. 

All the most important files are listed here. The number prefix of every file name indicates how far into the year that code was written. 
All python notebooks involved in analysing the results and some of the large images in the report are in the folder "Analysing Results."
