# 3YR-Project

This is the Public Repository for my 3rd Year Undergraduate Project on Classification of Brain Tissue Using Multiparametric MRI. 
A few useful notes:

- All the most important files are listed here. 
- The number prefix of every file name indicates how far into the year that code was written. 
- All python notebooks involved in analysing the results and some of the large images in the report are in the folder "Analysing Results."
- txt files with feature importances or other results obtained are not included
- The datasets referred to as Separate, Short Combined and Full Combined in the report are respectively referred to as Combined, Random and Full in the code.
